 * @brief       round robin scheduler based on highlevel timer module
 *
 * module name: sched_round_robin
 *
 * This module provides round robin scheduling for all
 * runable threads within each not masked priority.
 * Priority 0 (highest but hardware (irq)) is masked by default
 * not to be round robin scheduled.
 *
 * This implementation tries to find a balance between
 * low resources (static memory: a timer and an uint8),
 * fairness in terms of CPU time share and simplicity.
 * But it does round robin the runqueue when the timer ticks
 * even if the thread just got the CPU.
 *
 * This module might be used if threads are not divisible
 * into priorities and cooperation can not be ensured.
 *
 * @par Usage:
 * - add `USEMODULE += sched_round_robin` to Makefile
 *
